Two options to have the required libraries:


 a ) installing directly in your system (R for most of the work, and Python for the network part)
 
 or
 
 b ) using the yml files to create conda environments (both for R and Python provided)
    (you need anaconda or miniconda installed) 
    
    
 For both cases, check you have the system requirements: INSTALL_sysrequirements.txt
