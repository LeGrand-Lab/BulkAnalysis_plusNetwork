Three jupyter notebooks are available in folder `networks_explore`:
* LR_networks_all.ipynb : networks data manipulation, LRinfos and Networkx objects saved into dictionnaries, then into two binary files.
* LR_nx_to_igraph.ipynb : transforms Networkx objects into igraph objects, then into separate graphml files
* Young_D7_test_initial.ipynb : checks properties and how to get connected components (using Young D7 for demo purposes)

We will add a Creative Commons licence after submission of our manuscript (very soon).
