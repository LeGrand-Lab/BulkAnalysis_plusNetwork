## BulkAnalysis_plusNetwork

This repository contains a bio-informatic analysis related to Skeletal Muscle Repair in Aged vs Juvenile backgrounds RNA-seq time-series (Chazaud + Feige + LeGrand teams).

This work is still under development. For information about code, see:
[link](scripts/README_scripts.md)

Three jupyter notebooks are available in folder `networks_explore`:
* LR_networks_all.ipynb : networks data manipulation, LRinfos and Networkx objects saved into dictionnaries, then into two binary files.
* LR_nx_to_igraph.ipynb : transforms Networkx objects into igraph objects, then into separate graphml files
* Young_D7_test_initial.ipynb : checks properties and how to get connected components (using Young D7 for demo purposes)

We will add a Creative Commons licence after submission of our manuscript (very soon).
